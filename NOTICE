INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY NOTICE
============================================================

This repository contains an original theoretical framework created by
Nobuki Fujimoto (藤本伸樹). The following apply:

1. ATTRIBUTION: All use of this work must clearly credit
   Nobuki Fujimoto as the original author.

2. THEORETICAL INTEGRITY: The author does not endorse modified
   versions of D-FUMT, Rei, or GFT that are presented as the
   original theory. Any derivative theoretical work must clearly
   state that it is a modification and not the original.

3. TRADEMARKS: "Rei", "0₀式", "D-FUMT", "GFT" (Graphic Formula
   Theory), and "Genesis Axiom System" are trademarks of
   Nobuki Fujimoto. This license does not grant permission to use
   these trademarks except as required for reasonable and customary
   use in describing the origin of this Work.

4. CERTIFICATION: Only certification programs explicitly designated
   as "Official Rei / D-FUMT Certification" by Nobuki Fujimoto
   represent the authentic theoretical framework. Unauthorized use
   of these names in certification or credentialing is prohibited.
   As of 2026, there are NO authorized third-party paid
   certifications based on Rei or D-FUMT.

5. DERIVATIVE WORKS: Rei / D-FUMT is a unified theoretical framework.
   Any system, course, certification, or publication that reproduces
   its core structures, definitions, axioms, or evaluation methods
   — regardless of naming — is considered a derivative work and is
   subject to the applicable license terms (CC BY-NC-SA 4.0 for
   theoretical content). Renaming the concepts does not exempt
   derivative works from these terms.

============================================================
THIRD-PARTY CERTIFICATION NOTICE
============================================================

There are no authorized third-party paid certifications, courses,
or credentialing programs based on Rei, D-FUMT, GFT, or any
component of this theoretical framework.

Any paid certification claiming to be based on this framework
that is not explicitly authorized by Nobuki Fujimoto is
UNAUTHORIZED and does NOT represent the authentic theory.

現時点で、Rei / D-FUMT / GFT に基づく第三者による有料認定・
資格・検定プログラムは一切認可されていません。
藤本伸樹が明示的に認可していない有料認定プログラムは、
本理論の公式な資格ではありません。

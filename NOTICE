PROTECTED COMPUTATIONAL MODEL ELEMENTS
============================================================

The following computational model elements are integral to
Rei / D-FUMT and are subject to derivative work provisions:

1. CENTER-NEIGHBOR SIMULTANEOUS COMPUTATION
   Any system implementing a computation model where a central
   value is simultaneously computed with surrounding/adjacent
   values as a language-level primitive.

2. PHASE-BASED IRREVERSIBLE PIPELINES
   Any system enforcing irreversible state transitions through
   type-level and/or runtime phase guards (e.g. Open → Sealed
   → Compacted or equivalent stage progression).

3. CURVATURE-PROPAGATING NUMERICAL MODELS
   Any system attaching curvature, energy, or genesis-derived
   metadata to numerical values and propagating such metadata
   through computation chains.

4. WITNESS-TRACKED TRANSFORMATION CHAINS
   Any system recording cryptographic witnesses for value
   transformations and using such witnesses for verification
   of computation integrity.

5. ZERO-ORIGIN GENERATIVE NUMBER SYSTEMS
   Any system axiomatizing the generation of numbers from a
   pre-numeric void state through staged phase transitions.

6. DIRECTIONAL COMPUTATION OPERATORS
   Any system providing direction-specified computation
   operators that select subsets of neighbors/dimensions
   for partial computation.

7. EXPLANATORY FRAMEWORK
   The conceptual descriptions, metaphors, and pedagogical
   structures used to explain the above elements are themselves
   part of the Rei model.
8. CONTRACTION-LIMIT ZERO STATES
   Any system defining a contraction-fixed-point zero state
   distinct from void, possessing non-zero energy at the
   zero-point limit of iterative dimensional contraction.

9. AXIS-PROJECTED DIRECTIONAL COMPUTATION
   Any system decomposing center-neighbor computation into
   axis-aligned projection pairs and computing gradients,
   curvatures, or symmetries along those axes as language
   primitives.

10. PRE-NUMERIC POINT PRIMITIVES
    Any system axiomatizing a "point" entity that exists
    prior to numbers, supports simplex generation through
    combination, and transitions to numeric types through
    explicit dimensionalization operations.

11. DECLARATIVE INVERSE COMPUTATION
    Any system providing an inverse operator that infers input
    structure from desired output values within a center-neighbor
    computational model, including constraint-based solution
    narrowing across multiple computation modes.

12. BASIS-DECOMPOSITION AND CROSS-BASIS RECONSTRUCTION
    Any system decomposing center-neighbor structures into
    alternative basis representations (directional, axial,
    symmetric, spectral, hierarchical) and reconstructing
    them in a different basis as a language-level primitive,
    generalizing extension/contraction chains.

13. OSCILLATORY MIRROR COMPUTATION
    Any system defining a mirror operator that alternates two
    transformation functions (forward/backward or expand/contract)
    with optional attenuation, computing convergence to fixed points
    as a language-level primitive on center-neighbor structures.

14. SPIRAL TRAVERSAL COMPUTATION
    Any system providing spiral-ordered sequential accumulation
    over center-neighbor structures with configurable direction
    (clockwise/counter-clockwise), start position, hierarchical
    depth control, and decay factors as language-level primitives.

15. Constant Contraction Theory Group (π/e/φ Contraction)
Theory: Constant Contraction Theory Group (定数縮小理論群)
Origin: D-FUMT (Dimensional Fujimoto Universal Mathematical Theory)
Author: Nobuki Fujimoto
Integration: Rei compress mode extensions (:pi, :e, :phi)
Description: Extends the contraction operation to use mathematical constants (π, e, φ) as attractors. π-contraction extracts periodic components, e-contraction fits exponential decay parameters, and φ-contraction produces self-similar golden-ratio structures. Non-commutative chaining of modes is supported.

16. Dimensional Spiral Zero-point Theory (DSZT)
Theory: Dimensional Spiral Zero-point Theory (次元螺旋零点理論)
Origin: D-FUMT
Author: Nobuki Fujimoto
Integration: Spiral extension operator ⤊/⤋, spiral_extend and find_spiral_zeros commands
Description: Unifies zero-extension theory with spiral number system theory. Dimensional ascent is modeled as a spiral traversal where each extension step carries a rotation angle. The near-recurrence theorem states that after p steps with twist 2π/p, the phase approximately returns—but at a higher dimension.

17. Infinite Extension Mathematics Theory
Theory: Infinite Extension Mathematics Theory (無限拡張数学理論)
Origin: D-FUMT
Author: Nobuki Fujimoto
Integration: Generalized extension subscripts (x >> :b for arbitrary base b)
Description: Generalizes zero-extension (0 → 0₀) to arbitrary numbers and symbols. Any value can serve as an extension base, making zero-extension a special case. Extension depth, base, root, and chain queries are provided. The asymmetry of extend-then-contract vs. contract-then-extend reflects information-theoretic irreversibility.

18. Contraction Theory (compress/expand Duality)
Theory: Contraction Theory (縮小理論)
Origin: D-FUMT
Author: Nobuki Fujimoto
Integration: Expand operator ◁, expand modes (:uniform, :maxent, :pi, :e, :phi)
Description: Formalizes compress and expand as a categorical adjunction (C ⊣ E). Since compression is generally lossy, expansion uses maximum-entropy reconstruction under constraints. The information loss metric L(m) = d(m, E(C(m))) quantifies round-trip fidelity.

19. Temporal Number System Theory
Theory: Temporal Number System Theory (時相数体系理論)
Origin: D-FUMT
Author: Nobuki Fujimoto
Integration: Temporal tag | t=expr in 𝕄 literals, evolve, at, temporal_diff, window commands, Temporal<T> type
Description: Adds a time dimension to multidimensional numbers. Supports time evolution under named rules (diffusion, wave, advection, custom), temporal slicing, differentiation, and windowed aggregation. Conservation laws are enforced for appropriate evolution rules.

20. Timeless Number System Theory
Theory: Timeless Number System Theory (無時間性数体系理論)
Origin: D-FUMT
Author: Nobuki Fujimoto
Integration: Timeless<T> type, extract_invariant, assert_invariant, timeless_project, timeless_pipe commands
Description: Categorical dual of Temporal Number System Theory. Provides type-level guarantees for time-invariant values and invariant extraction from temporal trajectories. Corresponds to Noether's theorem (symmetries → conservation laws). timeless_pipe enforces commutativity at compile time.

21. Quadrivalent 0π Theory
Theory: Quadrivalent 0π Theory (四価0π理論)
Origin: D-FUMT
Author: Nobuki Fujimoto
Integration: Quad type with literals ⊤, ⊥, ⊤π, ⊥π; resolve, certainty, collapse commands; extended ∧/∨/¬ operators
Description: Introduces a four-valued logic type beyond classical true/false. ⊤π (latent true) and ⊥π (latent false) represent values that may change under conditions, corresponding to quantum superposition, Buddhist śūnyatā (emptiness), and practical NULL semantics. The four values form a diamond lattice with complete truth tables for ∧, ∨, ¬.

Renaming symbols, rephrasing descriptions, or restructuring
surface syntax does not avoid derivative classification under
the applicable license terms.

Formal definitions of the protected constructs are provided
in "Rei Language Specification v0.1" (spec/REI_SPEC_v0.1.md).

Derivative works include, but are not limited to:
- Systems implementing center-neighbor simultaneous computation
  under any naming convention
- Phase-based irreversible pipelines regardless of phase names
- Curvature-propagating numerical models with renamed parameters

INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY NOTICE
============================================================

This repository contains an original theoretical framework created by
Nobuki Fujimoto (藤本伸樹). The following apply:

1. ATTRIBUTION: All use of this work must clearly credit
   Nobuki Fujimoto as the original author.

2. THEORETICAL INTEGRITY: The author does not endorse modified
   versions of D-FUMT, Rei, or GFT that are presented as the
   original theory. Any derivative theoretical work must clearly
   state that it is a modification and not the original.

3. TRADEMARKS: "Rei", "0₀式", "D-FUMT", "GFT" (Graphic Formula
   Theory), and "Genesis Axiom System" are trademarks of
   Nobuki Fujimoto. This license does not grant permission to use
   these trademarks except as required for reasonable and customary
   use in describing the origin of this Work.

4. CERTIFICATION: Only certification programs explicitly designated
   as "Official Rei / D-FUMT Certification" by Nobuki Fujimoto
   represent the authentic theoretical framework. Unauthorized use
   of these names in certification or credentialing is prohibited.
   As of 2026, there are NO authorized third-party paid
   certifications based on Rei or D-FUMT.

5. DERIVATIVE WORKS: Rei / D-FUMT is a unified theoretical framework.
   Any system, course, certification, or publication that reproduces
   its core structures, definitions, axioms, or evaluation methods
   — regardless of naming — is considered a derivative work and is
   subject to the applicable license terms (CC BY-NC-SA 4.0 for
   theoretical content). Renaming the concepts does not exempt
   derivative works from these terms.

============================================================
THIRD-PARTY CERTIFICATION NOTICE
============================================================

There are no authorized third-party paid certifications, courses,
or credentialing programs based on Rei, D-FUMT, GFT, or any
component of this theoretical framework.

Any paid certification claiming to be based on this framework
that is not explicitly authorized by Nobuki Fujimoto is
UNAUTHORIZED and does NOT represent the authentic theory.

現時点で、Rei / D-FUMT / GFT に基づく第三者による有料認定・

藤本伸樹が明示的に認可していない有料認定プログラムは、

============================================================
PROTECTED COMPUTATIONAL MODEL ELEMENTS
============================================================

The following computational model elements are integral to
Rei / D-FUMT and are subject to derivative work provisions:

1. CENTER-NEIGHBOR SIMULTANEOUS COMPUTATION
   Any system implementing a computation model where a central
   value is simultaneously computed with surrounding/adjacent
   values as a language-level primitive.

2. PHASE-BASED IRREVERSIBLE PIPELINES
   Any system enforcing irreversible state transitions through
   type-level and/or runtime phase guards (e.g. Open → Sealed
   → Compacted or equivalent stage progression).

3. CURVATURE-PROPAGATING NUMERICAL MODELS
   Any system attaching curvature, energy, or genesis-derived
   metadata to numerical values and propagating such metadata
   through computation chains.

4. WITNESS-TRACKED TRANSFORMATION CHAINS
   Any system recording cryptographic witnesses for value
   transformations and using such witnesses for verification
   of computation integrity.

5. ZERO-ORIGIN GENERATIVE NUMBER SYSTEMS
   Any system axiomatizing the generation of numbers from a
   pre-numeric void state through staged phase transitions.

6. DIRECTIONAL COMPUTATION OPERATORS
   Any system providing direction-specified computation
   operators that select subsets of neighbors/dimensions
   for partial computation.

7. EXPLANATORY FRAMEWORK
   The conceptual descriptions, metaphors, and pedagogical
   structures used to explain the above elements are themselves
   part of the Rei model.

Renaming symbols, rephrasing descriptions, or restructuring
surface syntax does not avoid derivative classification under
the applicable license terms.

Formal definitions of the protected constructs are provided
in "Rei Language Specification v0.1" (spec/REI_SPEC_v0.1.md).

Derivative works include, but are not limited to:
- Systems implementing center-neighbor simultaneous computation
  under any naming convention
- Phase-based irreversible pipelines regardless of phase names
- Curvature-propagating numerical models with renamed parameters
- Witness-tracked transformation chains with alternative hashing
- Zero-origin generative number systems with modified axiom names

As of 2026, there are NO authorized third-party implementations
of the Rei computational model.

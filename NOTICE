Rei (0₀式 / れいしき) — Mathematical Computation System & Programming Language
Copyright 2024-2026 Nobuki Fujimoto (藤本伸樹)

This product is based on D-FUMT (Dimensional Fujimoto Universal Mathematical Theory),
a comprehensive mathematical framework created by Nobuki Fujimoto.

Theoretical Components:
  - D-FUMT (次元藤本普遍数学理論) — Core mathematical theory
  - 0₀式 (Rei / れいしき) — Computation system based on zero extension theory
  - GFT (Graphic Formula Theory / 図式数式理論) — Visual graph representation
  - Genesis Axiom System (生成公理系) — Pre-zero axiomatization
  - USFT (Universal Sound Formula Theory) — Extension theory
  - UPFT (Universal Physical Formula Theory) — Extension theory

All theoretical work is the original creation of Nobuki Fujimoto.
